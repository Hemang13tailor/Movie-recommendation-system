## üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommender system built with Python and Scikit-learn, deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. 
The app recommends movies based on their plot similarity and fetches live data from the TMDb API.

# üåü Overview
This project presents a content-based recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their similarity to a movie they like. The core of the system is built on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare movie plots. The entire pipeline, from data processing to a user-facing web app, is designed to be efficient and scalable.

# ‚ú® Features
Content-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies based on plot summary similarity using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit allows users to easily select a movie and get recommendations.
Dynamic Data Fetching: Integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch real-time movie details, including posters and overviews.
Efficient Pipeline: A two-stage pipeline separates heavy-duty model computation from the lightweight live application, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

# üîÆ Future Enhancements
Hybrid Recommendation Model: Combine the current content-based approach with collaborative filtering (user-item ratings) for more personalized and diverse recommendations.
Improved Feature Engineering: Incorporate more features like genres, cast, director, and keywords into the similarity calculation.
User Accounts: Add functionality for user registration, watchlists, and movie ratings.
Advanced Search: Replace the dropdown with a live search bar.
